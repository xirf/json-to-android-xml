Remember what it felt like? These two shows will make you feel like that. \n\nHorimiya originally aired as a web comic in 2007, while the first Toradora Novel was released in 2006. Maybe this is while they feel so similar as they are both romantic slice of life anime written at similar times, as evidenced by the prevalence of dorky flip phones in both series. \n\nWatching Horimiya takes me back to a magical time in my life when I was first discovering anime and Toradora was one of the first anime I watched.\n\nAs for the similarities, both are excellently written high school romantic dramas with lovable characters that play off of each other really well. The jokes are funny, and the romance is exciting.  read more Both rom-com, both focusing on two high school students with a very different and distinct personality, both funny and more or less similar sense of humour. Both series have a very similar feel but slightly different passing in the main character development if you have watched either and liked it you will have a great time with the other one Both shows are slice of life romance anime set in a high school. The main girl in both shows is a tsundere, which is more apparent in Toradora, and she shows a side of herself to the main guy that she doesn't want to/let anyone else see. Both shows are more character-driven rather than plot-driven and are both, overall, just a good time. Really similar animes in terms of plot, especially at the beginning. Hori and Taiga both have somewhat unstable personalities.\n\nHOWEVER\n\nUnless you really enjoy the genre - i wouldn't reccomend you to watch Horimiya after Toradora. Horimiya feels more like a weak, more robotic (with artificial emotions) copy.\nWatching Toradora AFTER Horimiya - that is much better idea Both are good romcom animes with less misunderstandings  Two slice of life, comedy, romance anime with a nice cast of characters. Both are very standard slice of life anime, so if you want something different, this is the wrong place, but both anime do a the best job at being a standard slice of life anime. Both of these Animes are Romance/Slice of life genres. \n\nThey are sweet and heart warming when watching and focus on the small details which make the two lovers entwined with each other. Both have got a silly vibe about it, with adorable characters too. Though funny most of the time, I think there are still heart-heavy moments and that's why I love both of them. Both involve school and the characters in their day to day life. Both very wholesome, chill anime to watch :) Both are heartwarming light romcom type anime, showcasing characters in their day to day life.\nBoth mc often are viewed as something they are not,  either based on how they look or what they seem on the surface.\nBoth mc has a side they show where people outside their comfort zone normally wouldn't get to experience or see (Or that people normally wouldn't expect) They're both funny romance animes where you will roll over laughing and waiting for the next episode. Both don't have too much romance but just enough to pull at your heart. They're the same anime, but honestly, I'm not even mad, they're both great. Both series feature a group of friends navigating their complex romantic and platonic feelings for each other. \nBoth are about a guy and girl who are nothing alike and become best friends and something more..i think you'll love these both..  slice of life/romance littered with lovable friends and cute art Both are comedy, romance and slice of life and both are happening in high school. Main characters act in similar ways. It has the same Romance and characters that aren't how they seem on the outside that toradora has but has its own unique versions of it that's why I recommend it if you liked toradora. Both are easy watching, girly rom-coms that are about a guy and girl who are polar opposites and become best friends...and maybe more. You'll have to watch both to see and find out!","author":"TayaTuk"},{"pictureImage":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/1613/108722.jpg?s=e60b8d838f5083c9f84ebb1ac427c700","animeLink":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/41389/Tonikaku_Kawaii","anime":"Tonikaku Kawaii","mainRecommendation":"-Both light hearted \n-Both protagonists are fun to watch\n-Easy to consume\n-Both will make you shudder from the love >.< Looking for a fluffy, vanilla romance between lovebirds? If you enjoyed either Tonikaku Kawaii or Horimiya, you ought to check out the other. The main romantic pairings in both series quite quickly evolve past the sowing-the-seeds part of the romance, so they're focused on developing the extant relationship itself, smoothing out rough ends and coming to a mutual understanding of the relationship to bring things to an even keel. The two series generally keep spirits high, and while some drama happens, neither Horimiya nor Tonikaku Kawaii stray very far from a sugary lightheartedness with interspersed comedy. Tonikaku Kawaii dials the \"sugary\" setting to the max, so it's essentially drama-free. Horimiya runs almost an entirely positive vibe but does give space for some more somber introspection. Horimiya has more characters and a network interpersonal relationships to keep track of, but both it and Tonikaku Kawaii stick to the slice-of-life structure in keeping things mostly straightforward and character-driven.\n\nTLDR: This recommendation is based primarily on similarities in atmosphere and premise. read more Wholesome cute anime to just watch and laugh with the characters 1. in both anime character are nearly around same age\n2.

Both very wholesome and the characters are kinda similar\n Both have eccentric couples romance as well as being more focus on sol than on drama. Both have a great cast of characters with pretty mature personalities.  Their chemistry doesn't let many jokes fall flat.  Great sols that are more relatable to viewers that actually go outside (jk). Both have similar type of romantic comedy but instead of a school setting, it's at a workplace. and they're also otakus so you could probably relate to them. Both shows are great Romance shows with a bigger focus on the actual relationship of the main characters instead of the build up but don't completely neglect the build up. Romcom Anime.

Slice of life adorableness. Good to watch to brighten your mood! If you're into chill romance/comedy animes two animes are my recommendations. Both are romantic slice of life with comedic moments and relatable characters. They are more focused on the relationship itself than on getting in it. Both Horimiya and Wotakoi have really epic representations of relationships- though both at different points within someone's life- they aren't overly dramatized and feel really natural! Hilarious in their own lovely and unique ways, I definitely wish I could watch these shows for the first time again.","author":"Miiuco"},{"pictureImage":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/12/86676.jpg?s=3822719a1ce214e3f286eecb3e04a3c8","animeLink":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34902/Tsurezure_Children","anime":"Tsurezure Children","mainRecommendation":"Both animes works with the formation of couples. The most interesting thing about he two works is the characters development as love interests. Although, I would say that Tsurezure Children is linear in that field because, basically, all the couples are already quite engaging for a quicker romance so, the development doesn't enrich much as the counter part. Alas, Tsurezure has a bigger staff and the episodes are shorter compared to Horimiya, so, the fast romance is quite fair (it doesn't mean that it's bad... you certainly will have a favorite one between all of them). Going back to Hori-san to Miyamura-kun; potentially, it does have the projection of having love interests twists so, be caution when you're supporting an couple, otherwise, you can be hurt if they ever happen to change the partner but, overall, this is what makes to the anime. Not even a character you want to be left behind so it can be quite amusing to try to theorizes the hypothetical couple while filling the gaps between the characters and guessing their \"connection\" possibilities. Both will melt your heart 💘. read more Horimiya was the only anime that had similar vibes to Tsurezure Children and made me feel like watching one of the best short romance anime, again. Cute couples, lots of love, smiles, feels, fun and overall good time. Watch both in order to become a teenager in love once again! A great romance anime with multiple relationships in the same plot I think it's mainly the animation that gets me to pair these two together. Don't get me wrong, they're both romances and very lighthearted and comedic ones at that.\n\nAlthough there are some differences. Tsurezure Children is very short, and focuses on different relationships each episode while Horimiya focuses primarily on one. \n\nAlso just for reference, Horimiya skips through the manga's timeline, which sounds bad but isn't necessarily. Very good watch for both! Now that Horimiya is done airing, I’d like to recommend Tsurezure Children. Both of these anime feature multiple couples, and take place in highschool. Also, more people need to watch Tsurezure! Horimiya and Tsurezure Children focus on the relationship and(or) \"possible\" relationships of different couples.  Both anime explore how each couple acts and include some very endearing scenes. Furthermore, they are both very wholesome romcoms.  Both the shows deal with school life and love between high schoolers and have a similar slice of life tone to it.\n Horimiya focuses on the love life of Hori and Miyamura, Tsurezure Children shows the love lives of multiple couples. Has various kinds of love scenario's with young highshool kids. Both have a good balance of comedy and Slice of Life, but Horimiya is more focused to their mc love story. They are quite similar plotwise, cute and colourful teen romance where you get to see the development of their relationships with cheesy moments.\nThey're basically the type of show that will make you feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside :). If you want exactly  the same plot where there are different characters falling in love with each other then you should definitely try this !:-) Just good old fashioned romance with no unnecessary spice. Also both set in a high-school setting (because of course it is) Both are great, chill, wholesome romance animes that deal with couples making a fool out of themself to try and ask each other out. These are the perfect animes to watch when you just want a good ol' time to relax and watch wholesomeness in the making.  Personally, another connection I see between these two is the way the story is structured. Both animes feel like different stories each episode just with the same main cast of characters. Overall, these are both great whole romance animes that have likable ships and characters.","author":"AlCreed"},{"pictureImage":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/6/25254.jpg?s=be9f1a1456def4a46152304740533cbe","animeLink":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/7054/Kaichou_wa_Maid-sama","anime":"Kaichou wa Maid-sama!","mainRecommendation":"Its kind of amazing how similar the female leads in these shows are. Both are hardworking A+ students that tend to take on more work than they can handle. Both have difficult home lives mostly due to their fathers, and both have secret sides to them that they don't want their fellow students to know about. As result of their extra extracurricular burdens, they both end up developing relationships with guys from their school they otherwise wouldn't have become close with. \n\nMaid Sama is more definitely more \"shojo\", while I don't think Horimiya really targets one sex over another. But regardless I really like both shows and think that if you like one you will probably like the other. read more Both feature opposites attract kinds of romance set in a school, and both have a lot and I mean a lot of fucking cheesy lighthearted shit in it lol and both love interests have sides to them that they have to hide to their partner.  Gimmick in the romance, Misaki works at a maid cafe, and Miyamura has tattoos that shouldn't be seen.\nMisaki and Hori are very similar, fiery personalities, but caring with the one they love.\nBoth main girls work hard outside of school for their family. more on-off school times\nHORIMIYA is about a realistic situation of friend,lover story where MAID_SAMA is about more for fun kind of story means light rom-com type\ncouple relationship with comedy\none of my favorite anime both light hearted romances, very similar elements like main girl's personality outside of school Both animes are good romantic comedy animes. The genre is the same. Though, maid sama has more comedic romancce, horimiya has heartwarming romance. The understanding between main characters in both animes is beautiful.  Good-looking MC getting the girl to fall for her along with lots of funny scenes along the way, though horimiya has not finished these two have similar elements!      This love is simples and beautiful, is completed. You'll feel more one focus in romance in couples than in development form a unique par romantic, but have one couple more important from history. \n This show is very similar to Maid-Sama with it being Shojo, Slice of life, and a Rom-Com. We also have our main girl as a strong-willed badass. Our main boy is pretty much the opposite of Usui, however, he is still super cool and handsome. I had been searching for another show like Maid-Sama forever, and this show is it!  both anime have characters who love each other with one of them having a secret to hide. Very good story I liked the voices from both anime’s and the scenes were great","author":"Twintwine"},{"pictureImage":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/1222/108880.jpg?s=28d5a3f8fe3df089e938ace1c5b0e940","animeLink":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/145/Kareshi_Kanojo_no_Jijou","anime":"Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou","mainRecommendation":"The main girl's secret life is revealed to the main boy, as they develop a relationship over time. Other relationships around them develop between the supporting cast, while they each deal with varying levels of trauma. Said supporting cast is very lively, balancing the sad vibes with their happiness. Similar premise, setting and characters. Karekano focuses much more on the main couple, while Horimiya tries to flash out the supporting cast. Horimiya follows the same basic beats as Kare Kano, almost startlingly so, and the tone is similar as well. The comedy that leads into drama and back are present in both, and the series give same general impressions. The biggest difference is that Horimiya is more consistent overall with every episode being solid to great, while Kare Kano has the best 18 episode rom com with the final 8 episodes being of generally lackluster quality and ends on a low note. If you can deal with the recaps of Kare Kano, stop at episode 18, and are used to old style anime, Kare Kano is probably superior and generally more inventive while Horimiya is significantly more consistent and polished. read more Kare Kano and Hiromiya are the only School romances That bother to flesh out the characters and having an actual romance, and not just fooling around for more than 20 episodes.\n\nAlthough still idealized, far more meaningful than any other of her type that I know. Both romance actually contain progress and develop throughout the episodes, you won't get left with just hand-holding last episode, last minute. I recommend Kareshi Kanojo no Jijou if you're in the mood for some 90's romance, done by an amazing studio and characters are \ncharismatic, not soulless unlike many dramas. the MCs have a personality that is different from what they show in school\nthe influence of \"his and her circumstances\" on horimiya is quite obvious \nboth  have a really good romance Both animes are good romantic comedy animes. The genre is the same. The understanding between main characters in both animes is beautiful.  The initial plot is almost the same: both protagonists find the secret side of each other and start a lovely relationship. The humor and the supporting characters are also similar, so it's a great idea to watch both of them. Although, keep in mind KareKano gets more introspective and darker These two anime approach romance between young people in a more mature and realistic way. Showing the advantages and problems that come with it and also the individualities of each character\n\nI recommend you read Horimiya, the anime is not good as the manga, and a lot of details were cut from the anime Both of these series feature a main couple that we follow for most of the show, but they also have side characters with extended stories. As well as both shows taking place in a high school setting. As is typical, both start with the two love interests discovering something about the other, and both are love stories that develop very subtly and beautifully. Additionally, both look at the main love interests in a lot of depth, showing their flaws and their redeeming qualities. Finally, both are fast-moving love stories, so even though, the relationship feels like it is developing rather than stagnating in a slump.","author":"RPDoggo"},{"pictureImage":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/1179/119897.jpg?s=f642a2bad47bf9e016ec0efceb5bd13b","animeLink":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48736/Sono_Bisque_Doll_wa_Koi_wo_Suru","anime":"Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru","mainRecommendation":"Both wholesome romcoms about a couple who have different personalities, a popular girl and a shy, reserved boy. They learn about each other's secrets and befriend quickly which will then turn into a romance. Both shows are wholesome with a more grounded attempt at telling the romance within the story. Both shows deal with characters who exist on the opposite side of the social ladder and while both take their unique spin on the outcome of this relationship, they both are driven by the characters that exist within the world and not by the fan service other shows need to survive.\n\nI recommend both indivudually but if you liked one you would definitely like the other. Both are the polar opposites attract kind of romance story and lots of fluffly and cute romance in it too. Horimiya: Guy side seem to be playboy but actually quiet and nice guy to be boyfriend with\nMy Dress-Up Darling: Girl side seem to be gyaru that might use her influence to manipulate/force but actually nice girl that understand you and nice to be girlfriend with\n\nHorimiya: lack of uniqueness in story but fulfill with high tier art and top-notch relationship building instead\nMy Dress-Up Darling: lack of uniqueness in story but fulfill with ecchi and top tier art instead\n\nHorimiya: Guy went from being boring, quiet and basically have no friend to actually have nice girlfriend\nMy Dress-Up Darling: Guy went from being boring, quiet and basically have no friend to have very close girl friend (not girlfriend yet)\n\nHorimiya: Guy get to know that girl by incidental\nMy Dress-Up Darling: Guy get to know that girl by incidental\n\nOverall, My Dress-Up Darling is basically Horimiya but took top notch character development of all character out, put all focus on main character and add ecchi in. read more The same plot in which girl finds out guy's oddity , but instead of being bothered by it , girl accepts him and from there romance develops.....however, the difference was in one anime the guy looks more like a Yankee but he wasn't one, while in the other has a guy who is a complete loner with a secret fetish....when it come to the girls, in one anime it involves an ordinary girl that can kick butt, while in the other anime's girl, has her being an achiever and popular but like her guy , she too has a fetish.    Both shows are great wholesome rom-coms that show a shy loner and a popular girl slowly falling in love as they both start getting close (and eventually influenced) by the other. My Dress-Up Darling has a more traditional pacing and has a lot of great fan service, while Horimiya instead focuses on character development and is really fast-paced (in a good way overall). Both are some of the best shows the genre have to offer in my opinion and are very similar quality wise. Two main characters develop a relationship through similar interest Both shows are wholesome Romance shows that are entertaining and fun to watch. Kitagawa reminds me of Hori a lot, same with Gojo and Miyamura they both are the loner guys who are with the popular girl.\nOverall, both shows are amazing and I love them both, so if you like Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru then you might like Horimiya.\n If you are looking for a romance anime, these two are perfect for you, they perfectly do what they promise, the two female protagonists are wonderful, the story develops in an easy and peaceful way and keeps you hooked for the entire episode -Both are romance, slice of life, and comedy genre taking place in high school\n-Both have a main character/couple dynamic of popular girl and quiet/loner boy\n-Fluffy, feel-good animes that have you dying hoping the main couple will get together with some...more mature moments (only hints) too\n\nThese are two of the only romance animes I've seen that I've actually enjoyed.

Well here you go It's like in the same style but one is a straight romance and the other is a BL. Both are super cute romance animes. They have the early 2000s romance anime feel and they don't have unnecessary fanservice. They'll have you giggling and twirling your hair around your finger and you'll always root for the main couple. Both have very cute stories, plot, characters. Horimiya is more shoujo-forward while sasaki to miyano is BL.  - One of the leads/love interest has piercings\n- Comedy, High School, Slice of Life, Romance\n- About the love lives of the two leads, while lightly touching on the other character's love lives\n- Good sub and dub\n- In both series, characters struggle to be themselves, and it does become a part of the story line (Acceptance)\n- Similar character archetypes can be seen in the leads\n\n- In both of these animes, it's clear to me, that the creators did not want this to be your average Romance/BL: They wanted it to be more genuine. So, not over the top, but of course it still uses common tropes every now and then. \n\nThe tropes used, imho, were not toxic or harmful-- other than the miscommunication to slow down the pacing, that was dreadful... /nsrs\n\n- The characters have a lot of personality and there is a lot of logic and RELATABLE-ness that comes from these animes.

Both male protagonists have not had a great school life so far and are forced by circumstances to change that. There is a love story between couples in both series that you wouldn't expect, which sets the anime apart from the typical cliché. This is a big part of the charm of the series, as almost nothing goes smoothly and the exchanges are pretty cool.

Horimiya is a simple love story, knowing nothing but growth.\n\nBoth are good anime for those interested in how one would operate realistically in the situations they are placed under. Either that or they are just good rom-coms I would suggest you try out.\n read more These two are both series where a male classmate and a female classmate who are completely different in terms of personality coincidently meet up and learn more about the other individual. From there, the lives of both characters are never the same Both are about a guy who at first becomes antisocial and after certain events become \"popular.\" They are both romance anime. The characters are very well developed and with good evolution throughout the plot arcs.  In both series, the the f-mc is popular in school whilst the m-mc is considered a loner, gloomy, etc. \n\nBoth series involve where the f-mc helps the m-mc, and the m-mc becomes more sociable in school. The m-mc in both series, eventually joins the f-mc friend group.\n\nIn Jaku-Chara, the f-mc helps the m-mc in a more direct way, whilst the f-mc in Horimiya helps the m-mc more indirectly (by being there for him as a friend)\n\nHorimiya is more focused on romance, whereas Jaku-Chara is more focused on the gaming aspect.\n\nBoth have a slice-of-life feel to it, and are easy shows to watch These two are really similar by the fact when the main character is evolving from being the type of guy that isn't talking to anybody and has no social life to having a group of friends and especially a girl that helps him to \"grow\". In others aspects, without giving spoilers, Horimiya is different. Both are a high school romance series with a popular female lead and a male mc who was deemed as a \"social outcast\".","author":"JiangHaoyi1979"},{"pictureImage":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/1899/117237.jpg?s=0973a9cceca514f0bfe5a8d1c68feafc","animeLink":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/48926/Komi-san_wa_Comyushou_desu","anime":"Komi-san wa, Comyushou desu.","mainRecommendation":"The overall vibe of both shows are similar: pretty animation/art style, a high school setting, focuses on side characters a lot and has a very cute main couple. I think Horimiya has a bit more drama and heavier scenes, but overall but are pretty similar.  Both are light-hearted with a few cute moments. Both share a plot line of a lovable, timid character making new friends for the first time it's the guy here. you can skip the drama part but i think it's tolerable since it doesnt have much screen time. it's a wholesome anime. *i ship yanagi with yuki's sis From the same level of hype down to the concept: Slice of Life, School, the protagonist, Romance, Comedy,... I see the similarities everywhere. Both shows have shy introverted main characters who have difficulties with socializing, albeit one case being more extreme than the other, who first meet a person of the opposite sex in their class who opens up their whole world in a very wholesome way. While both shows are slice of life school romantic comedies, Horimiya focuses a bit on on the romance and the cast while Komi-san Can't Communicate focuses on Komi's character development and her goal.  Both are quite normal sol/ romance with the features of the main characters setting them apart from other school anime. Hori is a typical popular girl...except she is super homely at home and Miyamura is an introvert except he has many piercings and tattoos. Tadano is a generic mc except he can scarily read the room well, Komi is a cliche ojo-sama except she struggles to communicate. Both of these 'special' things slowly wear out as the plot continues and makes the show quite boring. While every Komi-san ep has a formula, Horimiya is just a premise and watching them go on wih their lives. Both have great animation and similar characters. read more Cute, comedic romance anime with interesting side characters.","author":"Nikki-Sapphire"},{"pictureImage":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/1301/93586.jpg?s=f19bb396363ae0caf8f1e1e8c17b49ac","animeLink":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/37450/Seishun_Buta_Yarou_wa_Bunny_Girl_Senpai_no_Yume_wo_Minai","anime":"Seishun Buta Yarou wa Bunny Girl Senpai no Yume wo Minai","mainRecommendation":"They are both about the hidden nature of their personalities and going forward in the story how they understand the other person and their own feelings. Both anime center around a relationship made possible through school between the hardworking girl and the lame/unknown guy that everyone at the school thinks makes no sense. with plots focusing on very different things, both anime always come back to the fun and dramatic relationship to keep the shows similar :) They both show a surprisingly mature relationship between teenagers, and they're also really funny in their chemistry. The animation is also very similar. I know it's not similar, but trust me you need to watch this.\nIts a slice of life, rom-com and SO WHOLESOME TO MELT YOUR HEART Fast progression in the story/romance. Fun, quirky, sometimes a bit kinky.

Both shows explore a relatively simple premise but do it to the best degree and accomplish all they intend. Both Shows are quite wholesome and have similar watching experiences. The only major difference is that Yahari follows more of a couple love triangle but i don't see that as a negative :) Is a simillar comedy/romance anime. Deep characters with their own mysterious past, that make them avoid some kind of romance.

Both involve an introverted 'quiet' MC and extroverted 'popular' FMC. Similar idea, kinda similar characters and their traits, same genre. Both have...\n-Troubled male MC who doesn't socialize with people all that much\n-Female MC who get's the guy to socialize\n-Supporting character that builds a group around the male MC\n\nThough Horimiya drifts away from the Mcs and gives audience a more detailed profile on the supporting characters. Less drama related and not so much about the relationship between the Mcs but it's a good anime to go to if you enjoyed Real Girl. Similarities:\nBoth have the \"unpopular with popular\" trope.\nBoth have side character romance\nBoth have a relationship in the start or early relationship.\n\nDifference:\n3D Kanojo MC is an otaku while Horimiya's protag isn't\nThe female lead of 3D Kanojo is kind of hated and has a record of dumping guys.\n3D Kanojo has more drama while Horimiya is chill\n\nHope this helps! The best way to describe how similar both of them are:\n1. The characters are hiding their own private lifestyle.\n2. Both series have more than 2 couples in the series.\n3. It has good character development in every character.\n4.

There's also similar comedy and both are very happy and relationship-focused shows. I get similar vibes from this anime. It's so much fun like Horimiya and also about a group of High School kids. First we get introduced to the ML and Fl and then with each ep we get introduced the other students and hilarity ensues. - Hilariously cute romcoms\n- Colorful diverse cast of loveable characters\n- Have the same enjoyable tone Both are High School romance animes, although Horimiya takes more romance into stance while Gekkan Shojou is more about manga art.

While Kimi ni Todoke focuses on the problems of young girls' socialization, Horimiya explores this problem from the male side and also adds a study on the problem of misunderstanding between teenagers.\n\n Despite some boundaries, individuals look past those \"flaws\" and really try to understand the nature of said other. This is true for both stories Horimiya and Kimi ni Todoke.\n\nWith rather superficially looking gloomy individuals Sawako and Miyamura find themselves with rather popular Hori and Kazehaya, only to bloom a growing relationship full of bliss that youth brings at such a time.\n\nBoth are good anime with great visuals to coin as their own, sharing equal amounts of drama and comedy. Both animes are just so beautiful. The character development is 10/10. The understanding between the main characters is heartwarming, Though kimi ni todoke is a classic romance, where the romance begins slowly, horimiya on the other hand, is a bit different. It mainly focuses on the growth after the relationship. Throughout this anime, this pretty much has a similar vibe to Kimi ni Todoke. One character is the loner/misunderstood student while the other character is an outgoing, popular student but wants everyone to get along with each other. Both of these animes have a \"pure\" vibe to them and have their romantic moments here and there. They both want to be together through their ups and downs and try to grow together as a whole with the help of their own friend group.","author":"RobertBobert"},{"pictureImage":"https://cdn.myanimelist.net/r/50x70/images/anime/2/85592.jpg?s=2779f485c4943624755d02baad87cf51","animeLink":"https://myanimelist.net/anime/34822/Tsuki_ga_Kirei","anime":"Tsuki ga Kirei","mainRecommendation":"Both are non-dramatic slice of life anime with actual romantic relationships.\nTsuki ga Kirei is not a comedy anime like Horimiya is, but if you enjoyed observing the relationships and their development you will definitely enjoy Tsuki ga Kirei as well.  If you are looking for anime romance, the conflicts are not too heavy, which can make you peaceful, and happy ending, I suggest you watch Tsuki ga Kirei\n\ntheir love is very, very beautiful Both stories are very chill, romance slice of life stories. They feel very natural, in conversation and in charachters. They both have very nice pacing and a wholesome feel that makes you want to see more of the charachters. Horimiya is a bit more mature with more comedy, but both stories are simple but executed very well. Both of these anime deal with a high school setting where the two main characters fall in love and see their relationship build. Normally romance anime that is all in a high school setting is full of tropes and not really realistic in life. Tsuki ga Kirei more than Horimiya is far more realistic in high school romance that I was so happy when the show ended.

The character focus in Horimiya is a lot more fickle and shifty, but the little moments make it altogether that more precious, from my own subjective standpoint, that is. If this recommendation gets you to try Horimiya out, tell them yzhriz sent you! Enjoy! (plus the OP and ED for Horimiya absolutely SLAPS so that's an added bonus) Chuunibyou demo Koi ga Shitai is a masterpiece romance anime. And so is Horimiya.

The only difference is if the pursuer in Koikimo is the man, the pursuer in Horimiya is the woman. The premise is established around the concept of unexpected circumstances with numerous comedic aspects while providing its focus on two characters having to form a romantic relationship with each other. So, if you like a romance series that has tons of surprising events that'll give you the sensation of romantic excitement, then I highly recommend this series for you.
